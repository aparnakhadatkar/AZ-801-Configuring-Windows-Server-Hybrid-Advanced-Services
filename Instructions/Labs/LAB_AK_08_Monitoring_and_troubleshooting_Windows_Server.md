# Lab 08: Monitoring and troubleshooting Windows Server

**Note:** An **[interactive lab simulation](https://mslabs.cloudguides.com/guides/AZ-801%20Lab%20Simulation%20-%20Monitoring%20and%20troubleshooting%20Windows%20Server)** is available that allows you to click through this lab at your own pace. You may find slight differences between the interactive simulation and the hosted lab, but the core concepts and ideas being demonstrated are the same. 

## Lab objectives
In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:
+ Exercise 1: Establishing a performance baseline
+ Exercise 2: Identifying the source of a performance problem
+ Exercise 3: Viewing and configuring centralized event logs
